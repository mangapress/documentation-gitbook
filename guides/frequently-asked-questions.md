# Frequently Asked Questions

## _I'm using the bundled theme for TwentyEleven, -Twelve, or -Thirteen but the Custom CSS and/or Insert Navigation options have no effect? Or they add a second navigation bar_

This is because the navigation for the comics is built into the theme. Using a different theme or overriding the default theme's template will allow you to use the options.

## _Is Manga+Press responsive?_

Not by itself. However, Manga+Press doesn't output markup other than the comic navigation. Responsiveness depends on the theme that is being used. The themes bundled with Manga+Press — the TwentyEleven thru TwentyFifteen child-themes — all have some level of responsiveness that is dependent on their parent themes.

## _Is Manga+Press compatible with Advanced Custom Fields_

Yes, it is! Manga+Press is simply a stripped down custom post-type with a custom Featured Image meta-box. Like any other post-type, you can add a new field group using ACF — however, you _will_ have to configure your theme to display these custom fields.

## _Is Manga+Press compatible with the WPML plugin?_

I have never had the chance to test Manga+Press with the WPML plugin so I cannot guarantee compatibility.

## _I set my Latest Comic page to be the home page in the WordPress admin, and now my comics won't show up. What happened?_

Unfortunately, setting the Latest Comic page \(or the Comic Archive page\) to be your Home/Posts page overrides the queries that are run on that page to pull the most recent comic and the past comics. This is by design. I hope to add some functionality in the near-future to correct this.

## _Do you take feature requests?_

I do take feature requests — however, there are a few criteria on which I judge each request:

1. Does the new feature fit with Manga+Press' current goals?
2. How well will the new feature fit with Manga+Press' current functionality?
3. The level of effort needed to integrate the new feature into the Manga+Press core.

## _Do you provide support for 3rd party themes?_

The only themes that I provide support for are the themes that come with Manga+Press, which are child-themes of the default WordPress themes.
